    <p> Gardening is a great way to keep active and safe now, even more than before since more people work from home due to the COVID-19 epidemic.<br>

        Our website has a vast selection of garden plants and flowers suitable for indoor and outdoor use. Quality, service, and value for money are the pillars of our company. We have our plant nurseries, but we also collaborate with other plant experts worldwide to bring you the most outstanding new and unique plants, golden oldies, and precisely what is popular today.<br>
        We aim to introduce houseplants into every household and promote the delight they offer. Krishnachura’s staff is dedicated to bringing nature into everyone’s house.<br>
        Plants, we agree, are excellent for the mind and spirit and should be available to everyone. We understand that not everyone has a lot of space or time to spend. That is why we work so hard to deliver high-quality goods with exceptional customer service so that people may buy and enjoy plants that suit their lifestyle in their homes, gardens, or office.<br><br></p>

      <!--This paragraph explain the importance of gardening-->

        <p>In 2021, the <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/health-and-wellbeing/articles/why-gardening-makes-us-feel-better" style="color:black"> RHS</a> published a study of 6,000 people that found that people who gardened every day had 6.6% higher happiness scores and 4.2% lower stress levels than those who did not.<br>
        Gardening is beneficial to one’s health and aesthetic of one’s home or garden.
        Obesity, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease, stroke, depression, colon cancer, and early mortality can all be reduced by 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity movement each week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC classifies gardening as a moderate-intensity activity and helps reach this 2.5-hour goal each week.<br>
        Irritability, headaches, stomachaches, heart attacks, and worsening pre-existing diseases are all symptoms of stress. Gardening has recently gained popularity as a clinically proven stress reliever. A study published in <a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/what_are_the_physical_and_mental_benefits_of_gardening" style="color:black;">the Journal of Health Psychology</a> compared gardening to reading as a stress reliever. Test participants who took part in gardening had significantly lower stress levels than those assigned to reading.
